Do you want to improve your neuroimaging research's reproducibility, but
you don’t know where to start? Are you overwhelmed by the number of
tools and approaches you can use to organize your reproducible research?
If yes, you’re in the right place!

This guide presents you with pre-selected practical recommendations and
useful resources on how to conduct a fully reproducible neuroimaging
research project. The guide covers topics such as basics of
reproducibility, preregistration, data/code organization and sharing,
and building reproducible neuroimaging workflows.

We built this guide based on subjectively selected resources and
experiences of the `Computational Neuroimaging Team <http://compneuro.umk.pl/>`_ at Nicolaus
Copernicus University in Toruń; thus, not all of our recommendations
might be suitable for all labs. Let us know if you find that we missed
something essential, or we can improve our workflow!

Introduction
------------

The progress of science is based on valuable research. While reading the
research paper you naturally trust the researchers that the presented
results are true and that you can build your research upon them. Recent
reports show, however, that scientists are not able to reproduce a large
amount of published research. In this section we introduce you to the
concept of reproducibility in research, reasons of reproducibility
crisis, and motivations to lead reproducible research. Finally, we
present you three steps that might improve reproducibility in your
research.

Preregistration
---------------

Preregistration is the practice of registering your detailed research
plan before conducting a study. The preregistered report format requires
researchers to submit a description of the confirmatory hypotheses,
variables, study methods, and analysis plan prior to data collection.

This practice allows researchers to circumvent the publication bias
toward significant findings and prevent the data from taking you
hostage. Preregistration also makes the distinction between hypothesis
testing and exploratory (hypothesis generating) research more clear. As
a result, the obtained results won’t affect the hypothesis and vice
versa.

Data sharing
------------

Reporting details about your scientific methods is no longer sufficient
to address the complex relationship between science and society. More
and more funding bodies require scientists to make their data public
after the end of the study. Sharing data in open repositories enables
other scientists to reuse your data to answer their research question or
to develop new analysis techniques. As a result, society could benefit
as much as possible from carrying every single scientific project.

Optimism about propagating reproducible science is challenged by the
complex ethical, legal, and social issues it raises. Below, we provide
explicit suggestions you may fulfill to change how you conduct the
study, before putting your neuroimaging data into a public repository.

Data structure
--------------

Neuroimaging experiments generate a complex set of data that can be
organized in many different ways. For many years, the research community
has been trying to find a way to effectively store and manage the data
collected from the fMRI scanner.

Data management
---------------

DataLad is a software tool designed to help with anything related to the
version control of of digital objects.

Analysis workflow
-----------------

BIDSApps, fMRIPrep, etc.

Code management
---------------

Neuroimaging data analysis involves generation of a code that allows
interpretation and validation of the scientific methods and results as
well as solving new research questions. Most researchers are not trained
in software engineering which often causes undocumented and disorganized
code, however sharing an imperfect analysis code is still much better
than not sharing at all. (Gorgolewski et al. 2016)

Here, we aim to provide the most optimal scientific practices where data
science code quality is focused on correctness and reproducibility.
Starting with a fairly standardized setup provides a clean, logical
structure of the code.
