    **Guide to reproducible neuroimaging research**

.. class:: center

    **Do you want to improve your neuroimaging research's reproducibility, but you don’t know where to start?**
    **Are you overwhelmed by the number of tools and approaches you can use to organize your reproducible research?**

    **If yes, you’re in the right place!**

This guide presents you with pre-selected practical recommendations and useful resources on how to conduct a fully reproducible neuroimaging research project. 
The guide covers topics such as basics of reproducibility, preregistration, data/code organization and sharing, and building reproducible neuroimaging workflows.

We built this guide based on subjectively selected resources and experiences of the `Computational Neuroimaging Team <http://compneuro.umk.pl/>`_ at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń; 
thus, not all of our recommendations might be suitable for all labs. 
Let us know if you find that we missed something essential, or we can improve our workflow!
