Different data types
=====================

The number of neuroimaging tools is large, ranging from electroencephalography to optogenetics to functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
However, not all types of analyzes have generally available tools for the analysis and documentation of datasets. 
Nevertheless, the open-source community is still working on solutions that can solve this problem using the most popular 
and easy-to-use tools such as Python, BIDS and the like.

In this section, we describe guidelines for documenting and analyzing data in an open and well-documented manner.

EEG and MEG
-------------

BIDS community being the result of the ongoing collaboration, shared knowledge, discussion and consesus - is constantly 
working on the continuous development of new tools for data analysis.

MEG + EEG Analysis & Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**MNE-Python software**  is an open-source Python package for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological 
data such as MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, and more. 

This Python package covers most types of data analysis workflow including preprocessing, visualization, source estimation, time-frequency analysis, 
connectivity analysis, machine learning, and statistics. 
All of those are covered and explained further in `Tutorials <https://mne.tools/dev/auto_tutorials/index.html>`_. 

The installation is quite easy, because it works with `pip install -U mne`.
